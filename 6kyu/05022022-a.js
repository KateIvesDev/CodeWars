/*Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]*/

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
            if (a[i] === b[j]) {
                a.splice(i, 1);
                i--;
            }
        }
    }
    return a;
}

//ALSO:
function array_diff(a, b) {
    return a.filter(e => !b.includes(e));
  }
